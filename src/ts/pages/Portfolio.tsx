                        I’m a junior web developer based in Belgium. My main focus is Frontend and I’ve a strong interest in UI and UX design. But I’m not afraid of the Backend part of development neither. 
                        <br />
                        I’m currently, through this portfolio, learning Typescript and strengthening my SASS skills.
